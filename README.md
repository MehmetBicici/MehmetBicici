### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Mehmet. I graduated from Suleyman Demirel University, department of electronics and communication engineering in 2021. 

#### When I was a student at university, I started to work at [EyeCheckup](https://www.eye-checkup.com/en/) as a machine learning engineer for 2 years at. After 2 years, I decided to become an IOS Developer. Because I have a business idea related to both mobile application and artificial intelligence. Now, I have been working as an IOS developer at [PlusMinusOne](https://www.plusminusone.co/).
